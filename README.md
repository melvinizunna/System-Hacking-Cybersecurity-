# System-Hacking
 A Cybersecurity Project
 In this project, I intend to focus on system hacking to identify and address security vulnerabilities within an organizationâ€™s computer systems. Given the high priority of security and compliance for most organizations, it's crucial to understand how attacks such as spoofing, smurfing, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) are designed to harm or disrupt operational systems.

The project will be divided into several key phases:

    Footprinting: I will gather all available public information about the organization. This will include using open-source intelligence to collect data such as domain names, IP addresses, and any other relevant information.

    Scanning: Next, I will identify open ports, services, operating systems, and configuration issues on the target systems. This phase will help in understanding the network structure and potential entry points.

    Enumeration: In this step, I will gather detailed information about the network, including NetBIOS names, shared resources, policy and password details, users and user groups, routing tables, and audit and service settings.

    Vulnerability Analysis: Finally, I will identify network vulnerabilities, application and service configuration errors, accounts with weak passwords, and files and folders with weak permissions.

Using the information collected from these phases, I will perform system hacking to test the security of the target systems. This will involve using various hacking techniques and strategies to exploit the identified weaknesses. The goal is to uncover vulnerabilities and security flaws, and to evaluate the effectiveness of additional security measures.

The labs included in this project will provide real-time experience in exploiting underlying vulnerabilities using various online tools and system hacking techniques. It is important to note that all activities will be conducted ethically and within the boundaries of the law. Proper authorization will be obtained before performing any system hacking to ensure compliance with organizational policies and legal requirements.
