# System-Hacking
 -A CYBERSECURITY PROJECT

 In this project, I intend to focus on system hacking to identify and address security vulnerabilities within an organizationâ€™s computer systems. Given the high priority of security and compliance for most organizations, it's crucial to understand how attacks such as spoofing, smurfing, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) are designed to harm or disrupt operational systems.

The project will be divided into several key phases, utilizing various tools for each step:

    Footprinting: I will gather all available public information about the organization using tools such as:
        WHOIS: To gather domain registration details.
        Maltego: For comprehensive data mining.
        Recon-ng: For automated reconnaissance.
        Google Dorks: For advanced search queries.

    Scanning: Next, I will identify open ports, services, operating systems, and configuration issues on the target systems using tools like:
        Nmap: For network discovery and security auditing.
        OpenVAS: For vulnerability scanning.
        Nessus: For in-depth scanning of potential vulnerabilities.

    Enumeration: In this step, I will gather detailed information about the network using tools such as:
        Netcat: For networking and debugging.
        SNMP: For gathering network device information.
        Enum4linux: For enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems.
        NBTscan: For scanning NetBIOS names.

    Vulnerability Analysis: Finally, I will identify network vulnerabilities, application and service configuration errors, accounts with weak passwords, and files and folders with weak permissions using tools like:
        Metasploit: For developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
        OpenVAS: For vulnerability assessment.
        Burp Suite: For web vulnerability scanning.
        Nikto: For web server scanning.

Using the information collected from these phases, I will perform system hacking to test the security of the target systems. This will involve using various hacking techniques and strategies to exploit the identified weaknesses. The goal is to uncover vulnerabilities and security flaws, and to evaluate the effectiveness of additional security measures.

The labs included in this project provide real-time experience in exploiting underlying vulnerabilities using these tools and system hacking techniques. It is important to note that all activities were conducted ethically and within the boundaries of the law.
